# hello-world
Documenting my initial efforts to utilize Visual Studio 2017 with other products
As a software quality analyst, I research, develop, and administrator applications and scripts when performing independent verification/validation with driving requirements for life cycle management of baseline codes.
Iâ€™m in the process of finalizing a database with an access front end and an SQL server backend serving SharePoint for user inputs through InfoPath forms.
My brainstorming/test environment is separate from my sandbox development/production environment. Having an issue understanding how to develop web parts with Visual Studio Enterprise with my 365 SharePoint host to test the SharePoint foundation connection for my test environment?
